# Anime Vault

**Anime Vault** is a web application built with Next.js that allows users to explore a vast collection of anime shows and books. The application uses infinite scrolling to fetch and display anime content smoothly, providing a seamless browsing experience.

## Features

- **Infinite Scrolling**: Browse anime shows with a smooth infinite scrolling feature, which dynamically loads more content as you scroll down.
- **Anime Shows**: Explore detailed information on various anime series, including titles, descriptions, release dates, and genres.
- **Books Library**: Discover books related to anime themes and genres.
- **Search Functionality**: Quickly search for your favorite anime shows or books.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**:
  - Next.js
  - CSS for styling (or any CSS framework like Tailwind CSS, if applicable)
  
- **API**:
  - Fetch data from external sources like the [MyAnimeList API](https://myanimelist.net/apiconfig/references/api/v2) or
  - [AniList API](https://anilist.gitbook.io/anilist-apiv2-docs) for anime, and [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/using) for books.
